  // Let's say we have an array

  // You might think we can just do something like this:
  players[2] = 'gus';

  // however what happens when we update that array?
  console.log(players, players2);

  // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
  // When we are dealing with an aray, changes goes back to the reference.
  // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
  // What we need to do is to create a copy of that array instead of referencing to it.
    // Changing it back to the original array
    players[2] = 'Ryan';
  // There different ways to do that:
  copy1 = players.slice();
  copy1[2] = 'gustavo';

  // with Objects
  const person = {
  name: 'gustavo',
  age: 25,
  social: {
  twitter: '@Gustavoaz7_'

  }
  // and think we make a copy:
    //const clone = person;
    //clone.name = 'gus';
    //console.log(person, clone);
  // how do we take a copy instead?
  const clone = Object.assign({}, person);
  clone.name = 'gus';

  // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const clone2 = {...person};

  // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
  clone.social.twitter = '@codemaster';
  console.log(person, clone);
  // This will not work for any nested object.
  // Returning to the original social object.
  person.social.twitter = '@Gustavoaz7_';

  // A method that works as it transform the object in a string, modify then transform it back to an object:
  const clone2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
  clone2.social.twitter = '@codemaster';
