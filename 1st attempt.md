**Thoughts:** I really struggled on my second [JS kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/572af273a3af3836660014a1) today. 
I don't think I was supposed to take that long (over an hour) to complete it but it was quite rewarding when I finally did it. 
PS: I chose the hard way on this one. Instead of coding for only 3 strings, I did it for any given number of strings.

**Thoughts:** I'm now sprinting my way up on Codecademy JS Course so I can get back on track at FreeCodeCamp algorithms challenges.
(I was not feeling confident for those challenges before so I decided to hit the Pause button on that and start the JS Course to 
get a more solid basis)

### Failed
I did not code for 1h for the 2 following days. Despite I had coded for over 2h on other days and still had an average coding time 
of 1h+,I just broke the most important rule of this project.  
This is my last semester at the university and I had my final exams coming. Right now graduating is my main priority. This was my choice.  
Soon enough I will be graduated and I will be able to code for a longer period of time everyday.  
I am restarting this challenge and you can follow my progress [here](https://github.com/gustavoaz7/100DaysOfCode/edit/master/Log.md)
