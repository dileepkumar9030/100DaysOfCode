// Strict Mode
/*
This mode is enabled by typing "use strict" at the of a file or a function body.
This mode avoids JavaScript flexible interpretation
Examples of what changes in strict mode:
False is not equal 0 (nor true is 1)
'this' is undefined when the function is not called as a method
"this is the example number " + 3
