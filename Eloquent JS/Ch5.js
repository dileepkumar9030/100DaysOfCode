// Higher-Order Functions:
// Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
// Examples: forEach, map, filter, reduce


// JSON (JavaScript Object Notatio)
// Is basically an array of objects with key-value pairs used as data storage or communication format on the web.
// Most common JSON functions:
// JSON.stringify({...}) - converts to JSON format
// JSON.parse("...") - converts from JSON format



// Making a clear and clean code (i.e. creating separate functions to accomplish small tasks) instead of polluting your environnment with a lot of code is costly.
// It makes your code more inefficient.
// BUT it does not really matter in small scales or in human time scale (not computational).
