**Thoughts:** I really struggled on my second [JS kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/572af273a3af3836660014a1) today. I don't think I was supposed to take that long (over an hour) to complete it but it was quite rewarding when I finally did it. 
PS: I chose the hard way on this one. Instead of coding for only 3 strings, I did it for any given number of strings.
